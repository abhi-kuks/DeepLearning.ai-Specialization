# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera

**Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI**

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Introduction

This repository contains all my work for this specialization. All the code base, quiz questions, screenshots, and images, are taken from, unless specified, [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

## What I want to say

**CONTENT WARNING**

As a long-time self-taught learner, I have completed many Computer Science related MOOCs on Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, and Edx. I do understand the hard time we all spend on understanding new concepts and debugging your program. There are discussion forums on mostly all MOOC platforms, however, even a question with detailed description may need some time to be answered. Here,I released these solutions, which are **only for your reference purpose**. It may help you to save some time. And I hope that you don't copy any part of the code (the programming assignments are super easy if you read the instructions carefully), see the quiz solutions before you start your own adventure. This course is almost the simplest deep learning course I have ever taken, as the simplicity is based on the fabulous course content and structure.In addition to this , the course is built on the reputation of its founder, Andrew Ng, who teaches all five of the courses it offers so far.

Ng is seen as one of the leading figures in artificial intelligence, having founded and directed the Google Brain project and served as the chief scientist at the Chinese search giant Baidu, as well as having directed the artificial intelligence laboratory at Stanford University. He also happens to be the co-founder of Coursera itself, and it was his Stanford course on machine learning that helped launch the MOOC craze in the first place. It's a treasure given by deeplearning.ai team. I know I'm late on this course but better late than never before.
